# Java SE 17 - Advanced Language Features

Java seems to be around for ages. 10+ years ago, you had to write several lines of code to achieve simpler things, 
and if we talk about complex business applications where you used to have to combine the powers of 
frameworks like Spring, Struts, Hibernate, and some application containers like Tomcat or Jboss; the things probably 
became harder to cope.

But when you pass this steep learning curve, it all comes naturally to you, and from one moment to another, 
you know where to go to solve a tricky bug or how to build an API, no matter how verbose Java is. So being a 
java developer since 2008 sometimes is quite dull; at least, this statement was true some years ago.
